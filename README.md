# ProCandrV2
This repository is for a minecraft plugin called ProCandrV2. Candr means Cops and Robbers, this is a recoding of a Candr plugin
made by MussonKing who built against an outdated plugin called Command Helper. This was coded from a project I accidently deleted,
luckily I had kept the .jar of ProCandrV1 so that I could decompile it and rebuild it, hence the V2. This was my first plugin.

Do note, I did not use any comments because this was a solo project.
